A README.md file with these sections (here's a basic template):

☐ App Title: Contains a description of what the app does and optional background info.

☐ Screenshot(s): A screenshot of your app's landing page and any other screenshots of interest.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used.

☐ Getting Started: Include a link to the deployed app and your Trello board with the project's planning.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!
